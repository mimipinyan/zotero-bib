  abstract = {Forest growth and yield models are tools designed to provide forest managers with quantitative information on plantation development dynamics, the influence of various silvicultural manipulations like vegetation control, thinning, and fertilization, and the potential quantity and quality of forest products. Growth and yield models have a long history of development and use with increasing attention on modeling intensively managed plantations. Based on their construction and assumptions, growth models are of three primary types, namely (1) statistical; (2) mechanistic; and (3) hybrid. Both spatially-dependent and spatially-independent versions of these different model types have been used to model intensively management plantations. This chapter will explore these different modeling approaches, their ability to represent key silvicultural activities, and provide suggestions on the development and use of growth models for forest plantation management.},

The database was collected from permanent sample units, in Paraopeba county, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The stands were represented by Eucalyptus camaldulensis {\texttimes} Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid trees, with 3 {\texttimes} 3 meters of spacing. The data were divided into two groups: fitting and validating databases. Two nonlinear models (Strategy A and Strategy B) were developed using differential equations to estimate the basal area growth and yield of the sample units. The logistic model was fitted to estimate the volumetric yield as a function of age, site index and basal area. The efficiency of the systems generated by logistic model and models obtained by differential equations (Strategy A and Strategy B) was also compared to the efficiency of the system estimated by the Clutter model (Strategy C). The projection models used to estimate basal area obtained by differential equations were compatible with forest growth and yield, and the logistic model with covariates was compatible with volumetric growth and yield. Strategy A and Strategy B generated different thinning and harvesting options for different site indices, which is biologically consistent.},

  abstract = {We installed a thinning and fertilization study at five sites in mid-rotation Pinus taeda L. stands in the southeastern United States to examine treatment effects on diameter growth, basal area production, and volume increment. The treatments were four levels of post-thinning stand density (247, 494, 741 and 1235 stems ha 1) and two levels of fertilization (none and 224 and 28 kg ha 1 of elemental nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively), applied in four replications at each site using either a randomized complete block (3 sites) or a split plot (2 sites) design. Six years after treatment, thinning significantly increased diameter and diameter increment as the residual density level decreased and increased stand basal area, stand basal area increment, stand volume and stand volume increment as residual density level increased at all sites. Fertilizer significantly increased diameter and stand basal area increments at two sites and stand volume increment at one site; these sites had low initial leaf area index, a metric commonly used to assess the potential for response to fertilization. Diameter increment increased as initial diameter class increased. Larger trees grew faster than smaller trees at all sites and for all treatments. Diameter growth decreased as initial stand basal area increased, and fertilization significantly increased diameter growth for a given level of initial stand basal area at sites where fertilization affected diameter growth. Stand volume increment increased as diameter increment increased for crop trees (largest 247 stems ha 1), whereas stand volume increment decreased as diameter increment increased for all trees. The stand-scale `cost' for greater individual-tree diameter growth was a reduction in stand volume increment in the 247 stems ha 1 treatment; this reduction was 13 m3 ha 1 yr 1 across all sites compared with the 1235 stems ha 1 treatment, whereas the individual tree diameter growth `benefit' was 0.9 cm yr 1 when comparing these same treatments. Trade-offs were quantified between individual tree size and stand growth across the thinning and fertilization levels imposed in this study, which will be useful in empirical and process-based modeling efforts for predicting thinning and fertilization responses of P. taeda.},

Cultural treatments in the Georgia study include complete control of vegetation other than the planted pines with multiple applications of herbicide, annual fertilization, the combination of complete vegetation control and annual fertilization, and an intensive mechanical site preparation treatment. Complete vegetation control resulted in higher yield production at ages 10 to 12 yr than the intensive mechanical treatment at all locations. This regime also resulted in higher yield production than the annual fertilization treatment at four of six locations. Volume mean annual increment for 10- to 12-yr-old plantations with the combination treatment of complete vegetation control and annual fertilization ranged from 325 to 490 ft3/ac, growth rates comparable to those obtained at other high biomass production areas throughout the world. Our economic evaluation based on these results shows that 8 to 12\% real rates of return are feasible from investments in intensive loblolly pine plantations in the southeastern United States. South.

The model system described here estimates site index (SI) if dominant height (Hdom) and stand age are known (inversely, the model can project Hdom at any given age if SI is known). The survival (N) equation was dependent on stand age and Hdom, predicting greater mortality on stands with larger Hdom. The function that predicts stand basal area (BA) for unthinned stands was dependent on N and Hdom. For thinned stands BA was predicted with a competition index that was dependent on stand age. The function that best predicted stand stem volume (outside or inside bark) was dependent on BA and Hdom. All functions performed well for a wide range of stand ages and productivity, with coefficients of determination ranging between 0.946 (BA) and 0.998 (N). We also developed equations to estimate merchantable volume yield consisting of different combinations of threshold diameter at breast height and top diameter for longleaf pine stands. The equations presented in this study performed similarly or slightly better than other reported models to estimate future N, Hdom and BA. The system presented here provides important new tools for supporting future longleaf pine management and research.},

Data to calculate canopy variables were available only after age 22. Regression analysis indicates that a second-degree polynomial of SD1 is statistically related to both growth variables during the first two measurement intervals but not the last two. The shape of the significant equations generally agreed with conventional growth-growing stock relationships, and I,, adjusted for SDI, decreased significantly with age. Leaf area index (L) and foliage density (F) were linearly related to SD1 for each measurement period. While the equations relating F and SD1 were not significantly different between measurement periods, the intercepts of the fitted equations for L and SD1 generally decreased with plantation age. Mean-live-crown ratio (C,) was significantly related to SD1 for all measurement periods, with the exception of age 32, and canopy depth (C,) was statistically related to SD1 only at age 22. Significant multiple-linear regression models were found between the growth variables and canopy properties with one exception. With that one exception, I, was significantly related to L during each measurement interval and to F and C, during the first two intervals. Mean, gross, periodic-annual increment was statistically related only to those canopy variables that described canopy structure. With the exception of F, the overall average value of the canopy variables decreased with age in these loblolly pine plantations, probably leading to the systematic reduction in I, with age. Although growth-growing stock relations were not significant in these plantations after age 27, the relationships between canopy variables and canopy variables emphasize the importance of early density management to maintain vigorous crowns and growth rates as plantations age.},

As we are trying to increase carbon (C) sequestration through further enhancing pine plantation productivity by refinement of silvicultural regimes, whether a maximum productivity or the maximum potential C sequestration exists remains unclear. Our analysis of six long-term field trials indicated that a maximum productivity and a maximum response to silvicultural practices for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) exist across the species geographic range in the southern US. The maximum response was inversely proportional to the base site quality, and silvicultural treatments never increased productivity above that maximum. Further analysis of loblolly pine culture and density studies demonstrated that the effects of planting density and cultural treatment intensity on biomass production strongly interacted with site quality in that lower quality sites responded more to silvicultural intensity than higher quality sites. The results highlight that we can optimize silvicultural prescriptions for specific sites by changing silvicultural intensity depending on the site quality.},

Six generic model forms were identified. Models may be further categorized by whether they focus on weed population dynamics or on processes directly affecting growth of crop plants. There is scope for these aspects of vegetation modeling to be combined. Extremely complex models are scientifically satisfying as repositories of knowledge, but they tend to be excessively parametarized and recursive. Models with many parameters are difficult to fit to specific situations because they are ambiguous; the same overall estimates of growth can be achieved in a variety of ways.

The harvest profile of these plantations includes a large portion of young stands ages 8-15 that are biologically at or approaching the need to be first-thinned in order to maintain growth and productivity. Due to genetic improvement, better competition control practices, and fertilization treatments deployed since the 1990's, these younger stands are expressing an average site index value of over 80 feet (base age 25), which is considerably higher than older, less intensively managed plantations. As a result, these highly productive stands are reaching the self-thinning density limit at younger ages compared to stands with lower site index values. Age was typically used as a first-thin trigger in the past; however these younger stands may potentially lose live crown length at an earlier age.},

Karst.) were investigated in long-term thinning experiments on mineral soil sites in southern Finland. The measurement period was on average 27 years, and the intensity of the thinnings from below ranged from heavy thinning (45 per cent of basal area removed) to no thinning. Total stem volume increment and merchantable volume produced per hectare were the highest on the unthinned plots, but light and moderate thinning ( 30 per cent removed) reduced the volume increment by about 10 per cent. However, a part of the total production of unthinned plots was lost through natural mortality. On the thinned plots, natural mortality was considerably lower compared with the unthinned plots. The average diameter increment of all the trees, as well as the diameter of the largest trees, clearly increased with increasing thinning intensity. In contrast, dominant height increment was not affected by thinning. The stand age at the time of establishment of the experiments had no major effect on the growth reactions after thinning. Thus, heavy thinning results in earlier thinning yields and a higher proportion of larger-sized stems at the expense of a somewhat lower total yield.},

  abstract = {In 1994, a 17 yr old, slash pine spacing study was thinned to 35\% of the maximum stand density to evaluate the influence of prethinning stand conditions on postthinning growth after thinning to a common stand density. It was expected that plots thinned to a common growing stock level should have equal growth increments and if growth was not equal then the difference was related to prethinning stand conditions. Stand growth variables of quadratic mean diameter increment, stand-level basal area increment, and gross-volume increment were evaluated to determine the influence of initial spacing, stand density, and prethinning crown size before thinning and for 5 years after thinning. Lower values of relative stand densities were associated with initially wider spacings before thinning and higher values 2-5 yr after thinning. Before thinning, quadratic mean diameter increment was positively related to initial spacing and prethinning crown dimensions and negatively related to relative stand density. After thinning, quadratic mean diameter increment was not significantly influenced by initial spacing, but it was inversely correlated with prethinning crown ratio 5 yr after thinning as relative stand density increased. Stand-basal area increment was negatively correlated with prethinning crown width, crown ratio, and crown volume before thinning, but it was not significantly related to initial spacing or relative stand density before or after thinning. Gross-volume increment was positively influenced by initial spacing and prethinning crown dimensions and negatively related to relative stand density prior to thinning. These positive relationships were observed during yr 2, 3, and 4 after thinning where wider initial spacings produced larger increments in volume as relative stand densities increased. Prethinning crown dimensions remained correlated with gross-volume increment after thinning. However, after thinning, these correlations with prethinning crown dimensions held a consistent relation with postthinning growth and also conformed to conventional growth-growing stock relationships as stands developed. The significant relationships detected between gross-volume increment and initial spacing, prethinning crown dimensions, and relative stand densities support that prethinning tree characteristics affected postthinning gross-volume increment for the duration of this study.},

  abstract = {After two and a half decades under the influence of intensive cultural management, the trends and stand dynamics of loblolly pine plantations in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of Georgia are reported in this study. Annual fertilization, complete competition control, and a combination of the two treatments are applied to understand how loblolly pine plantations develop under lack of nutrition deficits and inter-species competition. Site indices for control treatments ranged from 73 to 93 base age 25 across the nine study sites with maximum mean annual increments in green tons ranging from 6.3 tons/acre/year to 12.0 tons/acre year. Overall treatment maximum mean annual increments reached 15.5 tons/acre/year in the combination treatment on the Waycross - Dry site. The majority of the site maximums for mean annual increment occurred in the combination treatment. Basal area per acre reached a maximum of 252.1 ft2/acre in the complete competition control treatment on the Dawsonville - Top site at age 25. Maximum total green weight achieved across the sites occurred on the Waycross - Wet site, where at age 23, an average of 275 tons/acre were on site. Productivity was good across all sites regardless of treatment. Coastal Plain sites saw the greatest gains in fertilization treatments throughout the duration of the study due to nutrient limitations. Piedmont sites saw the greatest gains in sites receiving competition control from establishment until crown closure, where fertilization regimes began to have greater gains.},

  abstract = {Application of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to midrotation loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands is a common silvicultural practice used to increase crop-tree volume production in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas and Louisiana. Studies in other regions have shown that midrotation herbicide application, with or without an application of fertilizer, can also benefit crop-tree growth. We studied the impact of herbicide (16 oz of imazapyr with 3.2 oz of surfactant ac 1), fertilizer (200 lb of N and 35 lb of P ac 1), and a combined herbicide fertilizer treatment on pine crop tree and competing woody vegetation growth in three, thinned midrotation stands for 5 years. The density and basal area of woody competition was significantly reduced (73--78\%) with an application of imazapyr, but was not affected by fertilization. The application of imazapyr inhibited height growth of the pine crop trees and without an application of fertilizer had little impact on basal area or volume growth during the 5-year measurement period. Fertilizer application increased merchantable volume growth (21.5--25.1 ft3 ac 1 yr 1), but response was low compared to that reported for loblolly pine stands elsewhere in the southern United States. Fertilization increased mortality of smaller, less vigorous pine trees. The combined herbicide fertilizer resulted in a 20.5\% increase in chip-n-saw volume, suggesting that the larger, more vigorous trees in these stands respond most rapidly to the combined herbicide and fertilizer treatments.},

The effects are modeled in relative terms so that the model can be parameterized based on any thinning experiment that includes an unthinned control, regardless of site conditions and stand age. {$\bullet$} The model was tested against observed thinning effects on growth and mortality from five temperate and boreal species (all species pooled r 2 = 0.51).

Levels of thinning were no thinning, or thinning applied 7 and 14 years after stand initiation. Levels of fertilization were no fertilization or broadcast fertilization with diammonium phosphate at age 7 years plus refertilization with urea, monocalcium phosphate, and potash at age 14 years. Longterm measurements of climate, stand development and productivity, projected leaf area index, and foliar nutrition were initiated at age 11 years. We found that by age 17 years, thinning increased mean live-crown length from 4.2 to 7.8 m, and mean tree diameter from 15.0 to 21.8 cm compared to the unthinned treatment. After rethinning at age 14 years, stand basal area increased 1.2 and 19.2\% between ages 15 and 17 years on the unthinned and thinned plots, respectively. Refertilization at age 14 years reestablished foliar N, P and K sufficiency, which increased leaf area index from 4.2 to 6.0 m2 m 2 on the unthinned plots and from 3.2 to 3.8 m2 m 2 on the thinned plots, and subsequently, increased gross stand biomass from 114 to 141 Mg ha 1 on the unthinned plots and from 78 to 95 Mg ha 1 on the thinned plots by age 17 years. Leaf area was an important factor controlling loblolly pine productivity. At our study site, however, competition for light and water and nutrition-limited foliage growth influenced the variability and scope of this relationship. Our results suggest that a positive and linear relationship between leaf area and loblolly pine productivity does not universally occur on loblolly pine sites.},

The key productivity parameters identified for the feller-buncher was piece volume and number of trees in the bunch, and for the skidder extraction distance, average piece volume and number of bunches picked up to make a turn. The ability of the loader to process increasing number of trees as average tree volume decreased, and the increased difficulty of delimbing the larger trees resulted in no significant variance for average piece size. Productivity functions were developed for the feller-buncher and the skidder.

Competing vegetation is often present in operational plantations and limits site resource availability. The benefits of MRT for pine productivity are well known, but competing vegetation growth has not been extensively studied. Pine and competing vegetation growth within two regions of the southeastern United States was monitored for 8 years following a one-time post-thin application of either fertilization (224 kg ha-1 of nitrogen plus 28 kg ha-1 phosphorus), chemical herbicide (0.8 oz glyphosate and 0.8 oz triclopyr L-1 of water) or their combination. Fertilization significantly increased pine volume growth in the Lower Coastal Plain (LCP, 2.67-4.01 m3ha-1yr-1) and the Upper Coastal Plain/ Piedmont (UCPIE, 0.203.72 m3ha-1yr-1). Chemical herbicide application in both the LCP (0.34-4.87 m3 ha-1yr-1) and UCPIE (0.89-1.97 m3 ha-1yr-1) also significantly increased pine volume. Chemical herbicide application, individually and combined, did not result in significant decreases in herbaceous vegetation, but reduced woody vegetation by up to -2.40 m3 ha-1yr-1 in the LCP and -5.67 m3 ha-1yr-1 in the UCPIE. Consequently, we suggest that competing vegetation response should be considered within site-specific management plans aimed at maximizing pine productivity.},

  abstract = {Interest in production of sawlogs from eucalypt plantations in Australia has increased as logging in native forests has declined. Management for sawlog production commonly involves early-age selection and pruning of potential sawlog trees, and thinning. Existing stand-level models developed using data from unthinned plantations, grown primarily for pulpwood, cannot provide accurate estimates of sawlog yield for thinned plantations, and further model development is required. We addressed this issue using an individual- tree distance-independent modelling approach. Data from thinning and pruning experiments at three sites in northern Victoria were analysed, and diameter increment models were estimated for three tested species, Eucalyptus globulus Labill., E. grandis Hill ex Maiden and E. nitens (Deane and Maiden) Maiden. A new model form with use of two indicator variables was designed in this study to compare the growth of sawlog trees selected in thinned treatments with their equivalent cohorts in unthinned treatments.  The best variables identified by regression analysis included initial diameter of the target tree, stand age, site index and time since thinning, together with a measure of thinning intensity (the removed basal area ratio) and a measure of inter-tree competition (basal area for the larger trees). Structured in this way, the developed models are flexible for predicting the thinning responses of selected sawlog trees for a wide range of tree size, site and stand conditions, and thinning treatments, leading to more accurate prediction of sawlog yield and associated size class distribution information. This result implies that better decisions on whether to thin may be achieved in plantation management practice. To provide the models with sound statistical properties, nonlinear mixed-model techniques were used to correct for within- and between-subject auto-correlation and heterogeneity of errors. Further study to validate the developed models for a wide range of stand and site conditions, and thinning treatments, using independent data is recommended.},

  abstract = {Abstract Growth response to thinning has long been a research topic of interest in forest science. This study presents the first 3--4 years of response of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) growth to thinning at different intensities. Data were collected from the East Texas Pine Research Project's region-wide loblolly pine thinning study, which covers a wide variety of stand conditions. Four treatments, light, moderate, and heavy thinning, respectively having 370, 555, and 740 residual trees per hectare after thinning, and an unthinned control, were included. Individual tree diameter at breast height (dbh) and total height were recorded annually for the first 3--4 years after thinning. Results indicate significant differences between treatments in dbh growth in each year after thinning, as well as for all years combined. Each thinning treatment had significantly greater dbh growth than the control in the first growing season with this positive response being more evident in the case of the heavier thinning or at the later years post-thinning. Conversely, the thinning effect on tree height growth was initially negligibly negative, then becoming positive after 2--4 years, with the heavier thinning becoming positive sooner. Tree size class, assigned based on prethinning dbh, had a significant effect on both dbh and height growth responses. Compared to the control, small trees had a greater response both in dbh and in height growth than the medium and large trees over the measurement period. At the stand level, the heavier thinning had significantly less stand basal area per hectare, but the difference in stand basal area per hectare between the thinned and the unthinned plots decreased with years post-thinning. Results from this study can improve our understanding in thinning effects and help forest managers make accurate decisions on silvicultural regimes.},

  abstract = {Intensive loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation management in the southeastern United States includes mid-rotation silvicultural practices (MRSP) like thinning, fertilization, competitive vegetation control, and their combinations. Consistent and well-designed long-term studies considering interactions of MRSP are required to produce accurate projections and evaluate management decisions. Here we use longitudinal data from the regional Mid-Rotation Treatment study established by the Plantation Management Research Cooperative (PMRC) at the University of Georgia across the southeast U.S. to fit and validate a new dynamic model system rooted in theoretical and biological principles. A Weibull pdf was used as a modifier function coupled with the basal area growth model. The growth model system and error projection functions were estimated simultaneously. The new formulation results in a compatible and consistent growth and yield system and provides temporal responses to treatment. The results indicated that the model projections reproduce the observed behavior of stand characteristics. The model has high predictive accuracy (the cross-validation variance explained was 96.2\%, 99.7\%, and 98.6\%; and the prediction root mean square distance was 0.704 m, 19.1 trees ha-1, and 1.03 m2ha-1 for dominant height (DH), trees per hectare (N), and basal area (BA), respectively), and can be used to project the current stand attributes following combinations of MRSP and with different thinning intensities. Simulations across southern physiographic regions allow us to conclude that the most overall ranking of MRSP after thinning is fertilization + competitive vegetation control (Fert + CVC) {$>$} fertilization only (Fert) {$>$} competitive vegetation control only (CVC), and Fert + CVC show less than additive effect. Because of the model structure, the response to treatment changes with location, age of application, and dominant height growth as indicators of site quality. Therefore, the proposed model adequately represents regional growth conditions.},

  abstract = {Thinning is a key silvicultural practice in southeastern pine plantations, aimed at improving tree growth, stand structure, and wood product value. While most research has focused on first thinning, limited data exist on second thinning and post-thinning treatments. Using long-term data from the Plantation Management Research Cooperative Mid-Rotation Treatment Study, we evaluated the effects of first and second thinning at three residual basal area levels (11.5, 16.1, and 20.7 m2/ha), with or without additional fertilization, vegetation control, or both. Both thinning events reduced tree size inequality and growth dominance while enhancing individual tree diameter growth. However, unthinned stands maintained higher stand-level basal area, volume, and volume growth. Additional fertilization and vegetation control improved diameter, basal area, and volume growth after the first thinning at 16.1 and 20.7 m2/ha but showed limited or no effects after the second thinning. Fertilization also increased height growth at higher thinning levels after the first thinning, whereas vegetation control had no effect on height. Neither fertilization nor vegetation control significantly increased total stand yield or affected stem density, stand density index, tree size inequality and growth dominance at any stage. Thinning shifted wood product distribution by increasing sawtimber proportion and reducing pulpwood and chip-n-saw, with minimal impact from additional treatments. These results support more informed silvicultural planning and future modeling of mid-rotation management in loblolly pine plantations.},
